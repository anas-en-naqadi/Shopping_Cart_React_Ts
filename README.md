# Shopping Cart with React & TypeScript

## Overview

This project is a **shopping cart application** built with **React** and **TypeScript**. The application simulates a shopping cart system where users can add, update, and remove items from their cart. It includes product listings, cart management, and a summary of selected products.

## Features

- **Product Listing**: Display products with relevant details such as name, price, and description.
- **Add to Cart**: Users can add products to their shopping cart.
- **Cart Management**: View the items in the cart, update quantities, and remove products.
- **Price Calculation**: The total price of selected products is automatically calculated.
- **Persistent Cart**: The cart is persisted using local storage, so the user’s cart data remains even after page reloads.

## Technologies

- **React**: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **TypeScript**: Superset of JavaScript that adds static types.
- **CSS/Styled Components**: For styling the components.
- **React Router**: For handling page navigation.
- **LocalStorage**: For persisting cart data across page reloads.
